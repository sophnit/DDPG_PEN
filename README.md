# DDPG_PEN

This code is to implement Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient into a Gymnasium's pendulum environment:  https://www.gymlibrary.dev/environments/classic_control/pendulum/

This code builds off of Kera's Example found here: https://github.com/amifunny/Reinforce_Adventure/blob/master/DDPG_Keras_Example_wtih_Pendulum.ipynb

The main change to the code is replacement of the action space noise with the parameter space noise. There are also changes for hyperparameters and plotting
